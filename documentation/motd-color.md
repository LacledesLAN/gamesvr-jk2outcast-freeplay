# MOTD Color Guide

The text of player names and Messages of the Day (MOTD) can be inserting special characters. For example, if a user wanted their name to be blue they would type `^4name` as their name.

| Value | Color      |
| :---- | :--------- |
| ^0    | Black      |
| ^1    | Red        |
| ^2    | Green      |
| ^3    | Yellow     |
| ^4    | Blue       |
| ^5    | Light blue |
| ^6    | Pink       |
| ^7    | White      |
